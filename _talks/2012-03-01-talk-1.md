Abstract:  Integer matrices $A$ and $B$ are said to be $\mathbb{Z}$-similar if there exists $C \in \GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ such that $CAC^{-1} = B$. While the canonical forms of linear algebra provide a complete description of matrix similarity over a field, much is still unknown about $\mathbb{Z}$-similarity. We will briefly review finite-dimensional linear algebra and see how this theory breaks down when we try to apply it to $\mathbb{Z}$-similarity. We will then introduce a modern form of the Latimer-MacDuffee theorem to convert the $\mathbb{Z}$-similarity problem to computing isomorphism classes of certain modules. We will explain how the simplest case of this isomorphism problem reduces to the number-theoretic problem of computing ideal class groups. We will conclude by characterizing the integer matrices whose $\mathbb{Q}$-similarity class splits into finitely many $\mathbb{Z}$-similarity classes.
