Abstract: With a proof spanning thousands of pages across hundreds of articles, the classification of finite simple groups is one of the monumental achievements of 20th century mathematics. In my talk, we will explore how finite simple groups act as the building blocks for all finite groups, and discuss the general strategy of the classification of such simple groups. We will introduce Feit and Thompsonâ€™s odd order solvability theorem and show how this theorem along with the Brauer-Fowler theorem provides a possible strategy of attack on the classification theorem.
