Education
======
* Ph.D in Mathematics, Purdue University, Starting Fall 2025
* BA/MA in Mathematics (Honors), Johns Hopkins University, 2021-2025
  * Secondary major: Philosophy

Research Experience
======
* Research Assistant, Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, Aalto University, summer 2024
  * Advisor: Professor [Vanni Noferini](https://math.aalto.fi/~noferiv1/)
  * Used module and number theoretic techniques to understand the similarity classes of integer matrices
    * Read sections of David Husert's dissertation "Similarity of Integer Matrices" and Irving Reiner's "Maximal Orders" for module theoretic background
    * Read sections of J.S. Milne's "Algebraic Number Theory" and "On principal ideal testing in algebraic number fields" by Johannes Buchmann for number theoretic background and algorithms
  *  Wrote an [expository report](Integer-Matrices.pdf) to aid in Professor Noferini's research
 
* Undergraduate Research in Mathematics course, Johns Hopkins University, fall 2024
  * Advisors: Professor Vanni Noferini (primary) and Professor [David Savitt](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/directory/david-savitt/) (secondary)
  * Continued summer project on integer matrices
  * Proved that the number of similarity classes of integer matrices with given minimal and characteristic polynomial is finite if and only if the minimal polynomial is squarefree
