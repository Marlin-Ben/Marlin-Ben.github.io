Starting fall 2025, I'll be a 1st year PhD Student in Mathematics at Purdue University. I'm broadly interested in number theory and representation theory and plan to work on the Langlands program. From fall 2021 to the present, I've been an undergraduate student studying mathematics and philosophy at Johns Hopkins University.

During my undergraduate studies, I also spent some time abroad. I attended the summer 2023 session of Budapest Semesters in Mathematics, which is where I was first introduced to representation theory. In the summer of 2024, I received funding through the Aalto Science Institute International Summer Research Programme to travel to Aalto University in Espoo, Finland, where I researched the similarity classes of integer matrices under the supervision of Professor [Vanni Noferini](https://math.aalto.fi/~noferiv1/). It turns out such similarity classes have a lot to do with the ideal class group of a number field, so this research served as my introduction to algebraic number theory. 

I am passionate about teaching and have worked as a teaching assistant for calculus, linear algebra, real analysis, and abstract algebra courses at Johns Hopkins. I believe that everyone has the potential to have enjoyable and fulfilling interactions with mathematics and it is our job as educators to foster such experiences through patient, compassionate, and enthusiastic teaching. I look forward to teaching and learning from the undergraduate students at Purdue!

Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time practicing Brazillian jiu-jitsu (that's me in the black rash guard below), playing basketball and tennis, and following my favorite sports teams (the New England Patriots and the Boston Celtics).
