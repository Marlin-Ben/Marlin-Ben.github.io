Teaching assistant for smaller upper-level real analysis course taught by [Richard Brown](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/directory/richard-brown/). In the first half of the course, we covered basic proof techniques and set theory as well as the theory of sequences, limits of functions, and differentiation on the real line. In the second half of the course, we covered sequences and series of functions and then defined the Darboux integral and proved some of its basic properties. We used Jiri Libl's "Basic Analysis: An Introduction to Real Analysis" as our primary textbook.

* This was an experimental writing-intensive version of the usual real analysis course at Hopkins. Some instructional time in lectures and recitation sections was explicitly dedicated to addressing how to write mathematics for audiences of varying mathematical maturity. Additional details can be found [here](Real-Analysis-Writing-Intensive.pdf).
