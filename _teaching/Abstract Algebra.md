Teaching assistant for nine student upper-level group theory course taught by [Yueqiao Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/yueqiaow/). We covered elementary group theory up to the Sylow theorems and the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups. We used M. A. Armstrong's book "Groups and Symmetry" as a rough guide.
